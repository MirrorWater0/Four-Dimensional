## Brief Description

Omnidirectional light, such as a light bulb or a candle.

## Description

An Omnidirectional light is a type of Light3D that emits light in all directions. The light is attenuated by distance and this attenuation can be configured by changing its energy, radius, and attenuation parameters. **Note:** When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 omni lights on a single mesh resource will result in omni lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be increased by adjusting ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object. **Note:** When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, omni lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.

## Properties

- light_specular: float = 0.5 [set set_param; get get_param; override Light3D]

- omni_attenuation: float = 1.0 [set set_param; get get_param]
  Controls the distance attenuation function for omnilights. A value of 0.0 will maintain a constant brightness through most of the range, but smoothly attenuate the light at the edge of the range. Use a value of 2.0 for physically accurate lights as it results in the proper inverse square attenutation. **Note:** Setting attenuation to 2.0 or higher may result in distant objects receiving minimal light, even within range. For example, with a range of 4096, an object at 100 units is attenuated by a factor of 0.0001. With a default brightness of 1, the light would not be visible at that distance. **Note:** Using negative or values higher than 10.0 may lead to unexpected results.

- omni_range: float = 5.0 [set set_param; get get_param]
  The light's radius. Note that the effectively lit area may appear to be smaller depending on the omni_attenuation in use. No matter the omni_attenuation in use, the light will never reach anything outside this radius. **Note:** omni_range is not affected by Node3D.scale (the light's scale or its parent's scale).

- omni_shadow_mode: int (OmniLight3D.ShadowMode) = 1 [set set_shadow_mode; get get_shadow_mode]

- shadow_normal_bias: float = 1.0 [set set_param; get get_param; override Light3D]

## Constants

### Enum ShadowMode

- SHADOW_DUAL_PARABOLOID = 0
  Shadows are rendered to a dual-paraboloid texture. Faster than SHADOW_CUBE, but lower-quality.

- SHADOW_CUBE = 1
  Shadows are rendered to a cubemap. Slower than SHADOW_DUAL_PARABOLOID, but higher-quality.
